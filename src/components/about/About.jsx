        <p>
          As a technology enthusiast coming from Sales and Customer Service
          roles within the Banking, Real Estate and Wholesale industries, I
          sought to transition into a field that leveraged my relationship
          building ability with my passion for solving complex problems. After
          working with Software Developers at BitBot, I began building
          Wordpress-based websites as a hobby. While I enjoyed building these
          websites for friends and relatives, I felt that I was not sufficiently
          challenging myself. I desired more control over the development
          process and I wanted to produce websites with advanced functionality.

          After extensive research, I began teaching myself Javascript and
          eventually enrolled at Fullstack Academy, where I deepened my
          knowledge of Javascript and gained proficiency in React, Node.js.,
          Redux, Express, Sequelize, and other technologies. Iâ€™m presently a
          full stack developer specializing in Javascript. I'm now looking for
          work for an organization where I can help solve interesting technical
          challenges.
